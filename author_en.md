Dear Friends and Visitors,

Thank you for visiting my site about my philosophical views and my music,

— Really, a philosophical book and music, all on one site — you may ask,

— It just happened so, but not accidentally.

Everybody is creating his (or her) own world, his environment. Someone does it by making conscious decisions, someone
is led by others. My choice was well though but it was not quick.

My book is my manifest, having been formed for years of thinking about a philosophical platform of a contemporary man,
who doesn't want to take anything for granted, but instead who is trying to rethink and consciously adopt the 
principles and rules of his life.

Music is an important part of my life path, my understanding of beauty and harmony. Composer opens laws of beauty as
scientist opens laws of nature. My music is also a part of my view on this world. It is also a part of my desire to
share these views with anyone who is open to listen.

Our life is also a composition of many things. We put together this puzzle from many pieces by composing and pulling
together very different elements. Everyone is making his own composition one way or another. I can't change everything
for good, but I can modestly try to improve the environment I am facing and what I am creating around myself.

Here is I wanted to share my world with you and I will feel my mission accomplished if this book can make you just
a little bit happier and if it helps you to find answers to the questions eluding you before and if my music can evoke
some bright emotions or just make your day a bit more pleasant.
